                    <p>I've had a passion for technology since a young age and have been involved with it since I was 8 years old. I gained experience in the technology industry by working in a Helpdesk position for three years. However, I've recently decided to make a transition into software development. Over the last year, I've been self-taught and have completed a boot-camp program to further my knowledge and skills. In doing so I found that I love building responsive and dynamic web experiences that include innovative solutions. but Iâ€™m not afraid to dabble in other areas of the tech stack including backend services and mobile apps. My ultimate goal is to work for a company that creates apps and technology that have the potential to change the world by providing innovative solutions. I'm enthusiastic about using my skills and knowledge to contribute to such a company's mission and vision.</p>
